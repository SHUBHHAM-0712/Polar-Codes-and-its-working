# Polar Codes ‚Äì CT216 Project Report (Group 31)

Welcome to the documentation repository for our academic project on **Polar Codes**, submitted as part of the *CT216 - Introduction to Communication Systems* course at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT).

## üìö Overview

Polar Codes, introduced by Erdal Arƒ±kan in 2009, are the first provably capacity-achieving error-correcting codes for symmetric binary-input memoryless channels. This project provides a detailed study on:

- Channel Polarization
- Polar Encoding and Decoding
- Bhattacharyya Parameter and Reliability Estimation
- Successive Cancellation and List Decoding
- Shannon Capacity Derivation
- Advanced decoding optimizations including:
- Large-small sorting
- Reed-Muller code identification
